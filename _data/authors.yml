  bio: >
    I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and have over twenty (20) years of 
    experience in all facets of acquisition and engineering to include acquiring, developing, 
    and managing software applications. I have spent the majority of my career 
    working for DCS Corporation developing specialized mission planning solutions for the
    United States Navy, Marine Corp, and Air Force. While working for DCS, I served as the Chief 
    Engineer (Systems / Software) for a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Maturity 
    Level 3 organization specializing in Agile software development.

    I co-founded Versagility Technologies in March 2016 where I serve as the 
    President / CEO. Since this time I have been developing microservice architectures 
    and web applications providing support for both logistics and mission planning.

    Outside of work, I am a father of three and an avid Washington D.C sports fan.

    Proud alumnus of Towson (BS) and Johns Hopkins (ME) Universities. Over 2 decades of 
    Department of Defense contract acquisition, management and engineering support. Before 
    I joined Versagility Technologies I spent 9 years as the Chief Technologist for a large company. 
    I spent most of my time advising DoD clients about the application of commercial industry best 
    practices for Information Technology and Systems Engineering to the DoD community. Now with 
    Versagility Technologies my responsibilities have not changed. They include development of organizational 
    technical strategy, business development, direct systems engineering consulting for clients, research 
    and development, staff development, training, and performing as technical advisor for high visibility 
    projects. Now with a small company, I’m enjoying every minute of the ride working alongside driven, 
    super smart folks with a singular focus… excellence. When I’m not working I enjoy watching sports, 
    taking orders from my 3 beautiful daughters and one amazing wife:-). Cheers!
